title: Victor Buendia's Complex Box
---

Hi! I am Victor Buendía, and this is my personal academic webpage. Welcome!

I am from Spain. My background is in Statistical Physics and applications to Complex Systems, and I got my PhD from both the University of Parma and the University of Granada in 2021. I work mostly on modelling systems from biology using ideas from stochastic dynamics, complex networks and phase transitions. 

I am currently working with Anna Levina, at the University of Tübingen.

Please feel free to find detailed information in the [CV page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/about.html %})

About myself, apart from science and math I enjoy playing and composing music and creating videogames. I love reading fantasy books and learning curious stuff overall. I do not like to fly. I believe that gives a good overview about me.
