<h1> Small bio </h1>

Hi! I am from Granada, a small city in the south of Spain. There I studied Physics and developed an interest
in numerical simulation and Statistical Mechanics. For this reason, I moved to Mallorca, where I did my Master
in Physics of Complex Systems at the Institute for Complex Systems and Cross-Disciplinary Physics. 
I worked under the supervision of Manuel Matías and Ricardo Martínez in the modeling of bacterial populations.

My PhD was done with Miguel A. Muñoz, in Granada and the Raffaella Burioni, in the University of Parma, in Italy.
During these years I worked on criticality and phase transitions in the brain; in particular, on the 
idea that the brain might be posed at the edge of synchronisation, performing both analytical and numerical simulations.

Afterwards I immediately joined the group of Anna Levina, in Tübingen, Germany, to start working more closely to data and experiments --although still from the theoretical side. From 2024, 
Now I work as a RTDA researcher (similar to a "non-tenured assistant professor") at the Bocconi University in Milan.

I do really like coding simulations, making efficient code and doing some math from time to time. My main research 
is the application of dynamical systems, stochastic processes and non-equilibrium phase transitions to understand 
neuronal dynamics in complex networks. I usually apply these tools to link neuronal structure and function, and 
to understand the role of dynamics in cortical computations.  

I do love playing and writing music, as well as playing videogames. Recently I have been very into traditional 
music from around the world, although I'm always open to any nice jam.
