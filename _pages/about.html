<h1> Education </h1>
<p text-align: left> (Click for details)</p>


<button class=cv-desplegable> PhD Student </button>
<div class=cv-panel>
<p>I am currently doing by PhD in a co-tutelle between the universities of Granada (Spain) and Parma (Italy), under the supervision of Miguel Ángel Muñoz and Raffaella Burioni, respectively. I started in November 2017.</p>
<br>
<p>I am mainly focused in the study of neuronal models, and in particular, we are working now in the role of inhibitory synapses in the brain.</p>
</div>

<button class=cv-desplegable> M.Sc. in Physics of Complex Systems (2017) </button>
<div class=cv-panel>
<p>I studied my Master Degree in the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems (IFISC), which is affiliated to the University of the Balearic Islands and the Spanish Research Council (CSIC). It was a 60 ECTS master. I obtained a mark of 9.42 over 10, being top of my promotion. I got several honor mentions in the master subjects.</p>
<br>
<p>My Master Thesis was done under the supervision of Manuel Matías (IFISC) and Ricardo Martínez (University of Princeton), proposing and analyzing (analytically and numerically) a model of bacterial growth mediated by quorum sensing. It is available <a href=https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/en/publications/modelling-quorum-sensing-mechanisms-in-bacterial-p/> here. </a></p>
</div>

<button class=cv-desplegable> B.Sc. in Physics (2016) </button>
<div class=cv-panel>
<p>I studied a 4-years 240 ECTS degree in Physics at the University of Granada (UGR), obtaining a mark of 8.20 over 10. I also obtained honor mentions in all subjects related to numerical simulation and statistical physics during the degree.</p> 
<br>
<p>My Final Degree work was done under the supervisision of Elvira Romera and Manuel Calixto (UGR). In this work I analyzed the quantum phase transitions in a 2-state bosonic model.</p>

<button class=cv-desplegable> Participation in Graduate Schools </button>
<div class=cv-panel>
I have assisted to the following schools for Graduate/PhD students:
<ul>
<li> <b>GEFENOL Summer School on Statistical Physics of Complex Systems</b>, held at IFISC in June 2016 </li>
</ul>
</div>


<button class=cv-desplegable> Introduction to Research Fellowships </button>
<div class=cv-panel>
I got two fellowships that allowed me to do short stays at research centers in Spain:
<ul>
<li><b>Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships:</b> July of 2016, working with Manuel Matías at IFISC in individual-based models for bacterial growth. This evolved into my Master Thesis later.</li>
<li><b>CNB V Introduction to Research:</b> September 2017: just after finishing my M.Sc. I was one month in the National Biotechnology Center, in Madrid, working at Susanna Manrubia's lab This was the beginning of my first publication. </li>
</ul>
</div>

<button class=cv-desplegable> Complementary Courses </button>
<div class=cv-panel>
During my higher education I have assisted to complementary courses, such as:
<ul>
<li> Python for Science (2016) </li>
<li> History of Physics (2016) </li>
<li> Introduction to Android Programming (2012) </li>
</ul>
