<h1> Small bio </h1>

I studied Physics at the University of Granada, and got interested in statistical physics and its applications. 
Then, I moved to Mallorca to study the Master in Physics of Complex Systems. 
After finishing my Master, I came back to Granada to start my PhD, in co-supervision with the University of Parma, in Italy.
I worked under the supervision of Miguel A. Muñoz and Raffaella Burioni styuding synchronization and its relationship with critical phenomena in the brain. 
Recently I moved to Tübingen, Germany, to continue researching about neuronal dynamics and evolution in the Levina Lab.
I also like a lot talking about science (in general), science fiction, playing videogames, and making music.

<button class=cv-desplegable> PhD in Physics and Mathematics (2021) </button>
<div class=cv-panel>
<p>I did my PhD in co-supervision between the universities of Granada (Spain) and Parma (Italy), with Miguel Ángel Muñoz and Raffaella Burioni, respectively. </p>
<p>My thesis, <i>Synchronous and asynchronous dynamics in Neuroscience: a Statistical Physics approach</i> is <a href="https://digibug.ugr.es/handle/10481/68021">publicly available</a> and received the <b>cum laude qualification</b> from both Universities</p>
</div>

<button class=cv-desplegable> M.Sc. in Physics of Complex Systems (2017) </button>
<div class=cv-panel>
<p>I studied my Master Degree in the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems (IFISC), which is affiliated to the University of the Balearic Islands and the Spanish Research Council (CSIC). I obtained a mark of 9.42 over 10, being top of my promotion. I got several honor mentions during the courses.</p>
<br>
<p>My Master Thesis was done under the supervision of Manuel Matías (IFISC) and Ricardo Martínez (University of Princeton), proposing and studying a model of bacterial growth mediated by quorum sensing. You can read it <a href=https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/en/publications/modelling-quorum-sensing-mechanisms-in-bacterial-p/> here. </a></p>
</div>

<button class=cv-desplegable> B.Sc. in Physics (2016) </button>
<div class=cv-panel>
<p>I studied a 4-years 240 ECTS degree in Physics at the University of Granada (UGR), obtaining a mark of 8.20 over 10. I also obtained honor mentions in all subjects related to numerical simulation and statistical physics during the degree.</p> 
<br>
<p>My Final Degree work was done under the supervisision of Elvira Romera and Manuel Calixto (UGR). In this work I analyzed the quantum phase transitions in a 2-state bosonic model.</p>
